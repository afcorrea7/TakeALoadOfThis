# What's this about?
Hi! If you are here it is probably because either: <br/>
<br/>
**a)** You found my other repos for games of mine and got curious. <br/>
**b)** I'm looking for a job and I'm one of your candidates.

Either way this repo's purpose is to (Hopefully) demonstrate my abilities as a programmer.
The repo is organized by folders, each one contains some code from each project I worked on

Please look around as much as you want to! A few files even contain new comments of what I could've done better or more efficiently, hindsight is 20/20 as they say.

> [!CAUTION]
> Obviously none of these files will compile, they are disimbodied pieces of code that I grabbed from projects I worked on and thought were good enough to showcase.
